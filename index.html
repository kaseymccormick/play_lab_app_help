<h1>Hello Makers</h1>
<p>This site is to collect all the information I've found in making a Play Lab app on code.org. With spring break coming up I wanted to provide some assistance while we don't meet. I'll be answering or providing solutions to problems that you run into and that I've run into. In addition to just helpful information and links to apps I manage to build for your reference<p>
